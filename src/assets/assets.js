I have to say that David is by far the BEST realtor we've ever worked with, his professionalism, personality, attention to detail, responsiveness and his ability to close the deal was Outstanding!!! If you are buying or selling a home, do yourselves a favor and hire David Marsden!!"

David and his skilled team helped make that dream a reality. The sale went smoothly, and we just closed on an ideal new place we're excited to call home. Nobody  knows Portland and the peninsula better than David. He really listens to clients and goes the extra mile with customer service, too."

He was candid, provided great feedback, helped explain clearly all details and managed the actual sale negotiation brilliantly. In addition, he was extremely responsive  to every one of my questions, no matter how small. As I move forward to now BUY my next house, I am extremely certain Dave will be the right partner to help me navigate this process."
